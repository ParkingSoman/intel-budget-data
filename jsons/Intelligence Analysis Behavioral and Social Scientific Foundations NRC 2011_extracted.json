In the IC's current environment of complex interconnected systems, risks are difficult to monitor, and uncertainty is inescapable. Unfortunately, because of this complex interconnectivity, even minor hazards can escalate to have large consequences (Perrow, 1984). This uncertainty is not all bad. New situations can bring new opportunities for process of innovation.At the same time, meeting new challenges can eschew unintended negative results that can be disastrous. Thus, integration processes should be undertaken mindfully. Intelligence needs to be as interconnected as the system of potential hazards might be. This interconnectivity means integrating intelligence analysis across agencies to help IC members \u201cwork the spaces between the cases\u201d (Hayden, 2009). REFERENCES Alexander, M.G.,M.B.

In the IC's current environment of complex interconnected systems, risks are difficult to monitor, and uncertainty is inescapable. Unfortunately, because of this complex interconnectivity, even minor hazards can escalate to have large consequences (Perrow, 1984). This uncertainty is not all bad. New situations can bring new opportunities for process of innovation.At the same time, meeting new challenges can eschew unintended negative results that can be disastrous. Thus, integration processes should be undertaken mindfully. Intelligence needs to be as interconnected as the system of potential hazards might be. This interconnectivity means integrating intelligence analysis across agencies to help IC members \u201cwork the spaces between the cases\u201d (Hayden, 2009). REFERENCES Alexander, M.G.,M.B.

In the IC's current environment of complex interconnected systems, risks are difficult to monitor, and uncertainty is inescapable. Unfortunately, because of this complex interconnectivity, even minor hazards can escalate to have large consequences (Perrow, 1984). This uncertainty is not all bad. New situations can bring new opportunities for process of innovation.At the same time, meeting new challenges can eschew unintended negative results that can be disastrous. Thus, integration processes should be undertaken mindfully. Intelligence needs to be as interconnected as the system of potential hazards might be. This interconnectivity means integrating intelligence analysis across agencies to help IC members \u201cwork the spaces between the cases\u201d (Hayden, 2009). REFERENCES Alexander, M.G.,M.B.

In the IC's current environment of complex interconnected systems, risks are difficult to monitor, and uncertainty is inescapable. Unfortunately, because of this complex interconnectivity, even minor hazards can escalate to have large consequences (Perrow, 1984). This uncertainty is not all bad. New situations can bring new opportunities for process of innovation.At the same time, meeting new challenges can eschew unintended negative results that can be disastrous. Thus, integration processes should be undertaken mindfully. Intelligence needs to be as interconnected as the system of potential hazards might be. This interconnectivity means integrating intelligence analysis across agencies to help IC members \u201cwork the spaces between the cases\u201d (Hayden, 2009). REFERENCES Alexander, M.G.,M.B.

In the IC's current environment of complex interconnected systems, risks are difficult to monitor, and uncertainty is inescapable. Unfortunately, because of this complex interconnectivity, even minor hazards can escalate to have large consequences (Perrow, 1984). This uncertainty is not all bad. New situations can bring new opportunities for process of innovation.At the same time, meeting new challenges can eschew unintended negative results that can be disastrous. Thus, integration processes should be undertaken mindfully. Intelligence needs to be as interconnected as the system of potential hazards might be. This interconnectivity means integrating intelligence analysis across agencies to help IC members \u201cwork the spaces between the cases\u201d (Hayden, 2009). REFERENCES Alexander, M.G.,M.B.
