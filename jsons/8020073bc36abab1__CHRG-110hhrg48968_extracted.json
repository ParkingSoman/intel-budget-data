This mobile training is synchronized with standard intelligence and privacy and civil rights/ civil liberties training offered to DHS intelligence officers. The set of training courses include a Privacy, Civil Liberties and Civil Rights Overview; Reports Officer Training; Intelligence Writing and Briefing; Critical Thinking and Analytic Methods; and Intelligence Oversight and / or the Criminal Intelligence Systems Operating Policies under Title 28 CFR Part 23. We have also hosted discussions with privacy rights advocates to capture their insights and understand their concerns. I must also mention the many staff officers in I&A who work tirelessly to support our State and Local Program Office in a variety of ways, whether through support to budgeting and planning or even the very real processes of preparing testimony for this committee on the program. It should not go unnoticed that these back office functions are every bit as important as the direct day-to-day analytical and technical support our office provides to our State and local customers. Our security division in particular provides direct security support to the fusion centers on a daily basis. They are in fact the security managers for each and every state and local partner, providing security clearances, facility clearances\u00e2\u20ac\u201dallowing the deployment of our secure IT platforms\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand general subject matter expertise. With the assistance of the Program Manager, Information Sharing Environment (PM\u00e2\u20ac\u201cISE) a combined Federal and State fusion center policy group has been created to take a continuous look at the issues affecting and relating to fusion centers. The National Fusion Center Coordination Group, co-chaired by our State and Local Program Director, Mr. Robert Riegle and Special Agent Mines, has taken a proactive approach to the formulation of standards for the centers in areas of training, civil liberties and civil rights, privacy and baseline qualifications for analysts. I felt it important to bring this to your attention as I know it to be a topic of great interest to you as evidenced by your inclusion of $\\$ 8$ million in the Iraq War Supplemental, to allow the State and Local Fusion Centers to address many of the concerns outlined in Mr. Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous visits before this Committee. I am pleased to inform you that $\\$ 500,000$ of this money is planned specifically for training in fusion centers on Civil Liberties and Privacy and will soon be delivered to our Civil Liberties and Civil Rights Office through an interagency agreement.",
