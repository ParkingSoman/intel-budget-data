The conferees direct the Secretary of the Navy to notify the congressional defense committees within 30 days of obligating funds provided for submarine industrial base expansion of the: obligation date, contractor name or names, location, description of the shortfall to be addressed, actions to be undertaken, desired end state, usable end items to be procured, period of performance, dollar amount, projected associated savings including business case analysis if applicable, contract name, and contract number. The conferees believe that expanding the capabilities of the second- and third-tier contractors in the submarine industrial base should lead to greater cost savings and improved efficiency as production increases to meet the Columbia-class schedule and higher requirement for Virginia-class attack submarines in the Navy\u2019s latest Force Structure Assessment.

In addition, the agreement includes an increase of $\\$ 36.2$ million for the Army, $\\$ 36.2$ million for the Navy and Marine Corps, and $\\$ 36.2$ million for the Air Force in support of unspecified military construction projects, with prior notification to the congressional defense committees, that support the European Deterrence Initiative. As noted earlier in this report, the conferees recommend the transfer of certain military constructions from the Base budget request to the Overseas Contingency Operations title of this Act. Specifically, these projects include: (1) $\\$ 53.3$ million for an Electrical System Upgrade in Bahrain; (2) $\\$ 77.4$ million for a Communications Station at Sigonella, Italy; (3) $\\$ 24.0$ million for an Air Traffic Control Tower at Azraq, Jordan; and (4) $\\$ 42.0$ million for a Munitions Storage Area at Azraq, Jordan. Finally, the conference agreement does not include an authorization or an authorization of appropriation for a High-Value Detainee Facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The conferees continue to have questions about the need to construct a new permanent detention facility with increased capacity and capabilities. Furthermore, the conferees believe the Department has not adequately assessed alternative options to support current and foreseeable detention requirements. Authorized Army construction and land acquisition projects (sec. 2901) The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 2901) that would authorize Army military construction projects for fiscal year 2020 for overseas contingency operations. The authorized amounts are listed on an installation-by-installation basis. The House amendment contained a similar provision (sec. 2901). The Senate recedes with a technical amendment. Authorized Navy construction and land acquisition projects (sec. 2902) The Senate bill contained a provision (sec. 2902) that would authorize Navy military construction projects for fiscal year 2020 for overseas contingency operations. The authorized amounts are listed on an installation-by-installation basis. The House amendment contained a similar provision (sec. 2902). The Senate recedes with a technical amendment.",
