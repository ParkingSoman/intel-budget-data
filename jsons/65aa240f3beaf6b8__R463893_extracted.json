One such leap is the application of AI/ML, but the Intelligence Community and DOD are \u201cstill awaiting solid results\u201d from AI/ML.86 Air Force analysts understand that achieving the lofty vision of a collaborative sensing grid cannot be reached without harnessing the promise of AI/ML and cloud computing technology. Space Force The Air Force ISR Dominance Flight Plan was published prior to the establishment of the U.S. Space Force, and therefore incorporated ISR From/For Space Operations within its strategy. This is a significant challenge and area of investment for the U.S. military as China and Russia have both initiated significant investments in their space and counter-space capabilities to mitigate U.S. advantages in the space domain. Space Situational Awareness Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is the intelligence driven capability to detect, track, and identify objects in earth orbit. The space domain has become increasingly congested and contested, and to ensure effective SSA, \u201csensors need access to intelligence\u201d in order to prepare the Space Force to fight and win in the space domain and support operations in other domains.87 SSA serves as the foundation for U.S. space control via surveillance of space objects and activities by gathering intelligence on adversary space operations. When paired with sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA Space Surveillance Network, SSA systems can surveil objects in orbit to provide early warning for satellite attack, space treaty monitoring, and technical intelligence gathering.88 SSA is a significant capability improvement as the U.S. military is increasingly dependent upon space for intelligence, position, navigation, and timing capabilities; communications capabilities; and missile warning capabilities. The Space Force requested $\\$ 44.8$ million for FY2021 to support RDT&E of SSA.89",

Human-Machine Teaming To maintain pace with the demands for intelligence, former Deputy Director of National Intelligence Sue Gordon stated that \u201cwe are going to have to make machines integrated into all of our processes.\u201d169 This perspective mirrors that of DOD ISR leaders who have advocated for human-machine teaming technology to provide the force better scalability, capacity, flexibility, and collaboration. Efforts to advance computing development and training initiatives will give ISR analysts the time and data they need to become more precise and effective in their analysis on warfighter problems.170 A prime example of DOD efforts to produce disruptive technology and enable human-machine teaming is Project Maven. Launched in 2017, Project Maven has led the DOD\u2019s AI/ML development of computer vision algorithms to improve target characterization and identification of objects within full-motion video and imagery. In addition, Project Maven is pursuing capabilities to support perception, natural language processing, recognition, and classification detection and tracking of objects.171 DOD has suggested that such AI-enhanced tools could allow human analysts to process up to two to three times as much data within the same time period, providing more time-sensitive targeting data and a reduction of collateral damage and civilian casualties.172 Project Maven received $\\$ 221$ million dollars in FY2020 appropriations, and DOD requested $\\$ 800$ million for FY2021 RDT&E to support both Project Maven and the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.173 Rear Admiral Parode also suggested a concerted focus on developing human-machine interfaces that spark and capture an analyst\u2019s intellectual curiosity by captivating their interest while simultaneously not creating a training burden.174 Such interfaces may be able to capitalize on human-machine interface technology produced by commercial video game companies. However, a significant challenge exists with algorithm development and the fielding of AI/ML capabilities: trust must be earned. Commanders and operators alike must gain trust and confidence in an algorithm\u2019s performance. Much the same way the U.S. military gains trust and confidence in its junior workforce, training, exercise, and experimentation will provide opportunities to gain trust and confidence in AI/ML performance.",

Human-Machine Teaming To maintain pace with the demands for intelligence, former Deputy Director of National Intelligence Sue Gordon stated that \u201cwe are going to have to make machines integrated into all of our processes.\u201d169 This perspective mirrors that of DOD ISR leaders who have advocated for human-machine teaming technology to provide the force better scalability, capacity, flexibility, and collaboration. Efforts to advance computing development and training initiatives will give ISR analysts the time and data they need to become more precise and effective in their analysis on warfighter problems.170 A prime example of DOD efforts to produce disruptive technology and enable human-machine teaming is Project Maven. Launched in 2017, Project Maven has led the DOD\u2019s AI/ML development of computer vision algorithms to improve target characterization and identification of objects within full-motion video and imagery. In addition, Project Maven is pursuing capabilities to support perception, natural language processing, recognition, and classification detection and tracking of objects.171 DOD has suggested that such AI-enhanced tools could allow human analysts to process up to two to three times as much data within the same time period, providing more time-sensitive targeting data and a reduction of collateral damage and civilian casualties.172 Project Maven received $\\$ 221$ million dollars in FY2020 appropriations, and DOD requested $\\$ 800$ million for FY2021 RDT&E to support both Project Maven and the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.173 Rear Admiral Parode also suggested a concerted focus on developing human-machine interfaces that spark and capture an analyst\u2019s intellectual curiosity by captivating their interest while simultaneously not creating a training burden.174 Such interfaces may be able to capitalize on human-machine interface technology produced by commercial video game companies. However, a significant challenge exists with algorithm development and the fielding of AI/ML capabilities: trust must be earned. Commanders and operators alike must gain trust and confidence in an algorithm\u2019s performance. Much the same way the U.S. military gains trust and confidence in its junior workforce, training, exercise, and experimentation will provide opportunities to gain trust and confidence in AI/ML performance.",
