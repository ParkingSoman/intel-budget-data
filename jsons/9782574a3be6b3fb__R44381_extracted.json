The constant dollars in Table 1 suggest that the NIP dollars appropriated in FY2017 (\\$56.7 billion) were roughly equal to the NIP dollars appropriated in FY2008 $\\$ 56.8$ billion). The highest level of NIP spending, in constant dollars, was in FY2011 (\\$61.7 billion). In contrast, the MIP dollars appropriated in FY2017 (\\$19.1 billion) were significantly less than the MIP dollars appropriated in FY2007 (\\$24.6 billion). The highest level of MIP spending, in constant dollars, was in FY2009-FY2010 (\\$31.1 billion). Figure 2 uses the data in Table 1 to provide an overview of total intelligence spending as a percentage of overall national defense spending. The almost flat percentage line suggests that annual intelligence spending has remained relatively constant over the past decade, consistently representing approximately $1 1 \\%$ of annual national defense spending.",
