This total includes $\\$ 15.8$ billion in procurement funding and $\\$ 15.7$ billion in research and development (R&D) funding. These figures represent 15 percent and 21 percent, respectively, of the total funding requested for procurement and R&D. According to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments7 : \u2022 Classified acquisition funding has more than doubled in real terms since FY 1995, when funding for these programs reached its post-Cold War low. \u2022 Since FY 1995, funding for classified acquisition programs has increased at a substantially faster rate \u2013 approximately $1 1 2 \\%$ \u2013 than has funding for acquisition programs overall, which has grown by about 77 percent. \u2022 Restrictions placed on access to classified program information have meant that DOD and Congress typically exercise less oversight over classified programs than unclassified ones.\nTABLE:\nCol1: 1995; FY: 1996; Col3: 1997; Col4: 1998; Col5: 1999; Col6: 2000; Col7: 2001; Col8: 2002; Col9: 2003; Col10: 2004; Col11: 2005; Col12: 2006; Col13: 2007 | Col1: Total DoD Weapons Acquisition; FY: 77.7; Col3: 77.4; Col4: 79.4; Col5: 82.1; Col6: 88.7; Col7: 93.2; Col8: 103.9; Col9: 110.9; Col10: 137.9; Col11: 147; Col12: 167.8; Col13: 178*; Col14: 179.8 | Col1: Classified Acquisition; FY: 11.7; Col3: 12.6; Col4: 13.2; Col5: 14.9; Col6: 15.8; Col7: 15.4; Col8: 18.1; Col9: 18.2; Col10: 26.1; Col11: 27.6; Col12: 29.8; Col13: 31.5*; Col14: 31.5 | Col1: %Classified; FY: 15%; Col3: 16%; Col4: 17%; Col5: 18%; Col6: 18%; Col7: 17%; Col8: 17%; Col9: 16%; Col10: 19%; Col11: 19%; Col12: 18%; Col13: 18%; Col14: 18% | Col1: ; FY: ; Col3: ; Col4: ; Col5: ; Col6: ; Col7: ; Col8: ; Col9: ; Col10: ; Col11: ; Col12: ; Col13: ; Col14:  | Col1: Total DoD Procurement; FY: 43.2; Col3: 42.4; Col4: 43.2; Col5: 44.9; Col6: 50.6; Col7: 54.9; Col8: 62.2; Col9: 62.2; Col10: 79.6; Col11: 83.2; Col12: 98.5; Col13: 105.3*; Col14: 103.8 | Col1: Classified Procurement; FY: 7.1; Col3: 7.3; Col4: 6.1; Col5: 6.8; Col6: 7.5; Col7: 7.5; Col8: 7.5; Col9: 8.9; Col10: 13.2; Col11: 14.5; Col12: 16.3; Col13: 16.6*; Col14: 15.8 | Col1: % Classified; FY: 16%; Col3: 17%; Col4: 14%; Col5: 15%; Col6: 15%; Col7: 14%; Col8: 10%; Col9: 10%; Col10: 17%; Col11: 17%; Col12: 17%; Col13: 16%*; Col14: 15% | Col1: ; FY: ; Col3: ; Col4: ; Col5: ; Col6: ; Col7: ; Col8: ; Col9: ; Col10: ; Col11: ; Col12: ; Col13: ; Col14:  | Col1: Total DoD R&D; FY: 34.5; Col3: 35; Col4: 36.5; Col5: 37.2; Col6: 38.1; Col7: 38.3; Col8: 41.7; Col9: 48.6; Col10: 58.3; Col11: 64.4; Col12: 69.3; Col13: 72.7*; Col14: 76 | Col1: Classified R&D; FY: 4.6; Col3: 5.3; Col4: 7.2; Col5: 8.1; Col6: 8.3; Col7: 7.9; Col8: 10.6; Col9: 9.3; Col10: 12.9; Col11: 13.2; Col12: 13; Col13: 14.8*; Col14: 15.7 | Col1: %Classified; FY: 13%; Col3: 15%; Col4: 20%; Col5: 22%; Col6: 22%; Col7: 21%; Col8: 25%; Col9: 19%; Col10: 22%; Col11: 20%; Col12: 20%; Col13: 20%*; Col14: 21%"
