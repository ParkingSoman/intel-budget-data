Covert action, both in support of the war effort and in other places, was also burgeoning during this period (see chapter 9).

To fund these activities, Congress passed a series of supplemental appropriations bills in the fall of 2001, five of which provided funding for the Agency over and above what had been appropriated in the annual intelligence bill. In all, they represented a 35-percent increase in the Agency\u2019s appropriation for the year. 2002 saw further increases in the Agency\u2019s appropriation as the country not only continued the war on terrorism, but seemed to be moving steadily towards possible military action in Iraq. Two supplemental appropriations bills were enacted that year, providing a 15-percent increase over and above what had been appropriated for the Agency as part of the intelligence authorization. After this, funding for the Agency began to level off, albeit at a significantly higher level than before the 9/11 attacks. While Congress did not appropriate all that the Bush administration had requested for FY 2003 and FY 2004, it did provide substantial increases each year over the previous year\u2019s appropriation.98 AUTHOR\u2019S COMMENTARY Exercising Power of the Purse As far as agencies of the executive branch are concerned, there is no more important power conferred upon the Congress than the power of the purse. The Constitution forbids agencies from spending money that has not been appropriated by the legislative branch. This simple requirement provides the foundation for nearly all the interaction that occurs between the two branches. Intelligence agencies, moreover, despite the inherent secrecy of their activities, are not exempt from this requirement. They need congressional approval each year\u2014formal approval from both the House and the Senate\u2014if they are to exist and operate."
