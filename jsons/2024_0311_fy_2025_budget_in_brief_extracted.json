The dedicated personnel of DHS work every day to prevent future attacks against the United States and our allies, secure our borders, respond decisively to natural and man-made disasters, and advance American prosperity and economic security. The Department continues to face a changing threat landscape, and we must remain vigilant to defend against and combat the dangers while facilitating lawful commerce, transportation, economic development, and the protection of privacy rights, civil rights, and civil liberties. The FY 2025 President's Budget provides the Department with resources to continue investment in critical capabilities and capacity needed to secure the homeland. Through the Southwest Border Contingency Fund, this Budget also supports our Southwest border operations as conditions change there. However, the Administration continues to call on Congress to pass the February bipartisan border security agreement to provide urgently needed resources and tools to our frontline personnel. These investments, and the many others not highlighted in this Budget in Brief, help ensure our men and women have the resources they need to accomplish the Department's critical mission of safeguarding the American people, our homeland, and our values."

This request supports next generation technological advancements that will continue to address key requirements in the security screening process while enhancing the passenger experience such as self-service screening capabilities, novel X-Ray diffraction systems, screening technologies for limited mobility passengers, advanced high speed cargo screening technologies, and high-definition advanced imaging technology systems. All systems would include advanced automated detection algorithms to meet detection standards while reducing secondary inspections. Additional funding would significantly reduce the required time and programmatic risk to transition successful technologies into operational settings."
