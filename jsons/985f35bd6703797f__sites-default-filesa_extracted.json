CLASSIFIED ANNEX TO THE COMMITTEE REPORT Pursuant to Section 364 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111\u00e2\u20ac\u201c259), the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) publicly disclosed on March 12, 2024, that the request for the National Intelligence Program for Fiscal Year 2025 was $\\$ 73.4$ billion. Other than for limited unclassified appropriations, primarily the Intelligence Community Management Account, the classified nature of United States intelligence activities precludes any further disclosure, including by the Committee, of the details of its budgetary recommendations. Accordingly, the Committee has prepared a classified annex to this report that contains a classified Schedule of Authorizations. The classified Schedule of Authorizations is incorporated by reference in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 and has the legal status of public law. The classified annex is made available to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives and to the President. It is also available for review by any Member of the Senate subject to the provisions of Senate Resolution 400 of the 94th Congress (1976).",
