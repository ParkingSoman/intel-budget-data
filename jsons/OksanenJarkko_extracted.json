In addition, its personnel process and analyze the information collected using the most advanced computers and a variety of specially developed techniques for extracting a maximum of information from the data.\u201d (Richelson 2016.) Two organizations are independent agencies (the ODNI and the CIA), and nine are Department of Defense (DoD) elements (including the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the National Security Agency (NSA), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)) 15. Seven are elements of other departments and agencies, including the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence; the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis and U.S. Coast Guard Intelligence; the Department of Justice\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Agency\u2019s Office of National Security Intelligence; the Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research; and the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis). (ODNI 2021.) The highest government authority at the executive level directing US intelligence efforts is the National Security Council (NSC). The NSC and the president work on the national security strategy and national foreign intelligence objectives and priorities, producing guidance for the intelligence community. The intelligence community is headed by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), a role established in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The DNI is situated in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), as is the National Intelligence Council (NIC), established in 1979. The director is the principal advisor to the president and the NSC in matters of national security intelligence. (Meese et al. 2018, 260\u2013261.) There are two intelligence programs that define the US IC\u2019s efforts. The National Intelligence Program (NIP) financially supports the activities of the CIA and is controlled by the ODNI. The Military Intelligence Program (MIP) is controlled by the DoD and funds the military entities involved in national security intelligence activities. Moreover, the NSA, the DIA and the NGA operate under both programs. (Lemieux 2019, 56.) According to the ODNI, the bulk of the requested US IC budget for 2022 (as confirmed in Intelligence Authorization Act for each fiscal year) belongs to the NIP $( \\$ 62.3$ billion) and the rest to the MIP ( $\\$ 23.3$ billion). The 9/11 Commission recommended the IC to declassify its budget, and the community has done so since 2011 for the NIP and 2012 for the MIP. (ODNI 2022b.)"
