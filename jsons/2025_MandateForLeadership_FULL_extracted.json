Burford headquarters\u2014named after the longest-serving BLM director, a Grand Junction native\u2014with a staff of 41 senior officials and assistants. Another 76 positions were assigned to BLM state offices in western communities such as Billings, Montana; Boise, Idaho; Reno, Nevada; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Cheyenne, Wyoming, to meet critical needs. Scores of other positions were assigned to the states that required BLM expertise. For example, wild horse and burro professionals were relocated to Nevada, home to nearly 60 percent of these western icons. Sixty-one positions were retained in Washington, D.C., to address public, congressional, and regulatory affairs, Freedom of Information Act compliance, and budget development. Despite the dislocating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the BLM successfully filled hundreds of long-vacant positions, as well as those that opened because of the move West. The BLM saw notable numbers of applicants for these positions\u2014 so numerous that the BLM capped the number of eligible applicants to no more than 50. Obviously, reduced commuting times (often from hours to mere minutes), lower cost of living, and opportunity to access vast public lands for recreation made these jobs attractive to potential employees. Many, if not most, applicants stated they would not have applied had the positions been based in Washington, D.C. At the same time, western positions attracted those with the skills needed to meet the BLM\u2019s multiple-use, sustained-yield mandate, disproving the claim that the BLM was suffering a \u201cbrain drain.\u201d The Trump Administration recognized that, despite its attractions, not everyone employed by BLM in Washington, D.C., could move West. The Administration applied a hands-on approach, with all-employee briefing and question-and-answer sessions, regular email communications, and a website devoted to frequently asked questions. Two human resources teams aided employees wishing to remain in federal jobs in the D.C. area: All received new opportunities. The BLM\u2019s move West incurred no legal challenges, no formal Equal Employment Opportunity or U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board complaints, and no adverse union activity. It is hard to please everyone, but the Trump Administration\u2019s BLM did just that, putting the lie to assertions, by some, that the BLM was trying to \u201cfire\u201d federal employees. The total cost of $\\$ 17.9$ million for relocation incentives, permanent change-ofstation moves, temporary labor, travel, printing, rent, supplies, equipment, and other contracts will save money for the American people. For example, in fiscal 2020, the BLM estimated $\\$ 1.6$ million in travel costs savings, which will grow slightly over time, and $\\$ 1.9$ million in savings from its terminated lease in Washington, D.C.

The total cost of $\\$ 17.9$ million for relocation incentives, permanent change-ofstation moves, temporary labor, travel, printing, rent, supplies, equipment, and other contracts will save money for the American people. For example, in fiscal 2020, the BLM estimated $\\$ 1.6$ million in travel costs savings, which will grow slightly over time, and $\\$ 1.9$ million in savings from its terminated lease in Washington, D.C. Furthermore, BLM estimated that, by October 2022, the BLM move West would generate a net savings of $\\$ 3.5$ million, which, the following fiscal year, would increase to $\\$ 10.3$ million."
