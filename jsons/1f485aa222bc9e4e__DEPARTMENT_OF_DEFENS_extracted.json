Since 2013, many CSGs, ARGs, and destroyers have been on deployment for 8- 10 months or longer. This comes at a cost to the resiliency of our people, sustainability of our equipment, and service lives of our ships. Maintenance and training backlogs have also reduced Navy's ability to maintain required forces for contingency response to meet Combatant Command operational plan requirements. Although the requirement calls, on average, for three additional CSGs and three additional ARGs to deploy within 30 days for a major crisis, Navy has only been able to maintain an average of one group each in this readiness posture. Root causes can be traced to the high operational tempo of the Fleet, longer than expected shipyard availabilities, and retirements of experienced shipyard workers, but the FY 2013 sequestration exacerbated the depth of this problem and interfered with our efforts to recover.",

Congress, specifically and uniquely, structured and prescribed the role of the Marine Corps as a \".balanced force-inreadiness, air and ground.to suppress or contain international disturbances short of large scale war.\" Under this mandate, Marines are forward-deployed, forward-engaged, and postured to shape events, manage instability, project influence, and immediately respond to crises. As an inherently joint combined arms tcam, Marines assure access and enable heavier contingency forces to deploy from the United States in response to a major contingency. Also, to meet the intent of the Congress, the Marine Corps must maintain a high state of combat readiness. We look at readiness through the lens of our 5 pillars of readiness - high quality people, unit readiness, capacity to meet the combatant commanders' requirements, infrastructure sustainment, and equipment modernization. These pillars represent the operational and foundational components of readiness across the Marine Corps. Our role as America's 9--1 force informs how we man, train, and equip our force, and how we prioritize and allocate resources across the pillars of readiness. While we wil always ensure that our forward deployed Marines and Sailors are properly manned, trained and equipped, we seek to maintain balanced investment across the pillars to ensure current and future readiness. We emphasize that all Marines and all Marine units are physically and mentally ready to deploy to any clime and place, at any time. The Marine Corps is a force of economy.

Threats to Power Projection andour Technological Edge Being able to project power anywhere across the globe by rapidly surging aircraft, ships, troops, and supplies lies at the core of our defense strategy and what the American people have come to expect of their military. It guarantees that when an acute crisis erupts anywhere in the world, America can provide aid when disaster strikes, reinforce our allies when they are threatened, and protect our citizens and interests globally. It also assures freedom of navigation and overflight, and allows global commerce to flow freely.

Rather than planning to reduce the active-duty force by 20,000 soldiers and the National Guard by 14,000 soldiers in Fiscal Year 2016, the Army will instead plan to reduce by 15,000 active-duty soldiers and 8,000 Guardsmen, while stil maintaining its schedule for reducing unit structure.

Given that our cruisers are the most capable ships for controlling the air defenses of a carrier strike group, and in light of anti-ship missile capabilities being pursued by other nations, this modernization program will, over the next decade and a half, be a baseline requirement for sustaining both our cruiser fleet and 1I carrier strike groups through 2045. I acknowledge and appreciate the plan put forward in the omnibus Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, which helps us get to our goal, and which we have begun to implement. However, this plan is more expensive, and results in shorter ship life.

NATO Reassurance: We are requesting $\\$ 789$ million for the European Reassurance Initiative, which the President created last year to help reassure our NATO allies and reinforce our Article V commitment in light of Russia's violations of Ukrainian   \nsovereignty.

[CLERK\u2019S NOTE.\u2014Questions submitted by Mr. Aderholt and the answers thereto follow:] CYBER SECURITY Question. The fiscal year 2016 Department of Defense budget request contains $\\$ 5.5$ billion for cyber activities, a growth of $\\$ 500$ million from the 2015 enacted level. Fiscal year 2016 will be the fourth year of the U.S. Cyber Command Cyber Mission Team (CMT) development. The CMTs are comprised of military, civilian, and contractors that will pursue defending the Department\u2019s networks from cyberevents and initiate offensive cyber activities against adversaries. The CMTs will reach full capability in fiscal year 2017 and it is estimated that 6,000 people will be required to fully staff the various teams. Secretary Carter, does the Department of Defense currently have the organic capability to ensure the security of our supply chain from a cyber perspective, meaning, does the Department of Defense have the internal ability to dismantle motherboards, computer chips, and other hardware that exist within our supply chain to ensure no backdoors exist? If not, how are you partnering with industry to build such a capacity? Answer. Yes, the Department of Defense (DoD) has organic facilities and technical expertise to perform analysis and reverse engineering of computing hardware and integrated circuits.Recently, in response to section 937 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, DoD established the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) and initiated an effort to federate its capabilities to facilitate support to acquisition program offices with software assurance (SwA) and hardware assurance (HwA) expertise, tools, policies, guidance, and best practices. The JFAC mission is to coordinate HwA and SwA capabilit",
