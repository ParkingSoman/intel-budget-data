To build on the foundational innovation measures created in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2024, the Committee recommendation continues to prioritize fostering a culture of innovation within the Department.

This includes funding provided above the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget request for counter-narcotics support, demand reduction, the National Guard Counter-Drug Program, and National Guard Counter-Drug Schools. The Committee recommendation also moves Mexico into the United States Southern Command area of responsibility, where it will get the attention it requires. To optimize the Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workforce and business operations, the Committee recommendation cuts over $\\$ 916,000,000$ from the budget request for the civilian workforce, while exempting employees engaged in shipyard, depot, mental health, and sexual assault and response duties. The recommendation provides additional guidance on the Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reassessment of manpower to ensure they are taking a hard look at how to use technology to reduce administrative tasks. Finally, to take care of servicemembers and their families, the Committee recommendation funds a 4.5 percent pay raise for all military personnel and includes $\\$ 2,500,000,000$ in support of an additional 15 percent pay raise for junior enlisted servicemembers. The Committee appreciates the input from the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, Members of Congress, industry, think tanks, and outside stakeholders as it worked to draft its recommendation for fiscal year 2025.",

PAY RAISE FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL The House fiscal year 2024 appropriations bill included funding above the budget request in support of an average 30 percent pay increase for junior enlisted servicemembers.

Notably, the review\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings revealed 12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 months delay in lead boat construction of the Columbia-class submarine, 24\u00e2\u20ac\u201c36 months delay in Virginia-class submarine construction, 18\u00e2\u20ac\u201c26 months delay in delivering the third Ford-class carrier, and at least 3 years delay in the lead Constellation-class frigate. Recognizing the importance of fleet capacity in power projection and the Chief of Naval Operations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 new force-level goal of 381 ships, the Committee is increasingly concerned by the long-term impacts of these delays. The Committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act, on the Navy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommended actions following the 45-day Shipbuilding Review and the Navy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s follow-on Shipbuilding Review, outlining plans and funding requirements for implementation. SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION The Committee is dismayed by delays in construction of the lead Columbia-class submarine. The program is the Navy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top priority and fundamental to the nuclear triad. The Committee recognizes the strategic importance of the Columbia-class program and has fully funded every shipbuilding construction request to ensure on time delivery of the lead boat and overall success of the program. The Committee is troubled that the Navy lacked the appropriate oversight of a program of such significance that it only learned of the year delay to the program in recent months. Further, the Committee notes the delays in the Columbia-class program will undoubtably impact Virginia-class submarine construction. Virginia-class construction remains challenged with production hovering at a 1.2 submarine per year cadence versus the necessary cadence of two per year. The Committee believes that given the findings of the 45-day Shipbuilding Review showing a delay of upwards of 3 years in Virginia-class submarine construction, that the Committee recommendation of one Virginia-class submarine, coupled with robust investment in the submarine industrial base, appropriately reflects the current capacity for submarine construction and deliberately targets funding to the industrial base to achieve long-term sustainable production. The Committee believes that providing significant and strategic investment in the Submarine Industrial Base (SIB) is necessary to achieving the (id:) $\" 1 + 2 \"$ production rate for the Columbia and Viriginia-class programs. Therefore, the Committee recommendation includes $\\$ 4,004,400,000$ for the SIB, including $\\$ 2,134,000,000$ in the Shipbuilding and Conversion account.

The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to ensure that the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account is executed by the Chiefs of the National Guard and reserve components with priority consideration given to the following items: acoustic hailing devices; aircraft survivability equipment and weapons training aids; aviation status dashboards; cloud defense solutions; crash-survivable UH\u00e2\u20ac\u201c60 helicopter gunner seats; degraded visual environment systems; improved thermal acoustic blanket; emergency response refuel equipment kits for C\u00e2\u20ac\u201c130/135 aircraft; internal auxiliary crashworthy, ballistically tolerant auxiliary fuel systems for UH\u00e2\u20ac\u201c60 helicopters; KC\u00e2\u20ac\u201c135 aircrew ground cooling units; land surveying systems; lightweight, rapidly deployable, computer-based artillery call for fire training and simulation; litter stabilization systems; modular small arms ranges and small arms training simulators and tools; secure enterprise, emergency, and social communication; software defined radios; UH\u00e2\u20ac\u201c72 Lakota mission equipment modernization; and upgraded commercial-off-the-shelf ground mapping for C\u00e2\u20ac\u201c130 aircraft.",
