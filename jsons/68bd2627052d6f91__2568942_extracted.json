She may be right or wrong, but clearly she could not accept his career aspirations. I also heard of a man who was turned down for a classified assignment because he and his wife shared everything about their workday, and he would not be able to do so without revealing classified information. This can take a toll on family life, so consider carefully whether your family can adjust to what one of my friends called \"The World of Shhh.\" The total budget of classified intelligence and military operations is steeped in mystery. One source claims that the current fiscal year budget request is over $\\$ 81$ billion to cover such operations.9 If the numbers are correct, then the national intelligence budget is roughly $\\$ 60$ billion and the military intelligence budget is around $\\$ 21$ billion per year. These numbers include classified hardware development and production, such as airplanes, satellites, and weapons, as well as intelligence operations. That is a lot of money and it grows every year. Needless to say, there are plenty of job opportunities in this realm for those who are interested and can get cleared. There are many operations within the federal government which require access to restricted information which should not be released to the general public. These positions employ persons who have a \"need to know\" certain classified information to do their jobs. Because the people who handle this information must be trusted to protect this information to avoid an adverse effect on national security should it be released, a process has been set up to assure that they are reliable, responsible, and trustworthy. Many military personnel obtain clearances as a requirement for their job, then carry the clearance into their civilian career. Other careers which may require clearances for sensitive positions include education, financial, intelligence, medical, and telecommunications. It is axiomatic that a clearance can add up to $\\$ 123,400$ to one's annual salary, since employers need not pay for the clearance process for someone already cleared, and is certain to obtain a dependable and welldisciplined employee. If roughly 3 million federal employees (both civilian and military) have some level of clearance, then perhaps half as many in the contractor community do. There are different levels of classification based upon the relative damage that could be caused by their disclosure of this information, which is assessed and established by the agency itself and is not subject to debate by an outside party. This means that an applicant who is cleared to a lower level cannot try to negotiate the agency to accept their lower level. Similarly, an applicant who doe",
