All of these challenges are set against the backdrop of a complex and dynamic global geopolitical environment that is exemplified and exacerbated by the triumph of our adversaries in Afghanistan after a 20-year struggle there as well as recent Russian outrages in the Ukraine and China\u2019s bellicosity both on its borders and in surrounding disputed regions. In spite of these ever-increasing operational pulls, our Army is consistently being asked to do more with fewer resources.

Needed Reforms Rebuild the Army. The total Army budget has decreased by roughly 11 percent since 2018, perilously affecting the service\u2019s readiness and ability to train and to procure new personnel and equipment.
