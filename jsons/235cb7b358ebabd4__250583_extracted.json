Although research spending by category is classified information, millions of dollars are being allocated to forensic science. Example efforts include: Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is the research and development arm of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). Analogous to the DoD\u2019s Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA), IARPA invests in high-risk, high payoff research programs to address the difficult challenges of the agencies and disciplines within the UIC. Research topics of interest to IARPA include forensics of multimedia, scalable discovery methods for pattern and data identification, and processes for analyzing and processing large amounts of data.",

In fulfilling this role, DIA has launched an initiative to establish a worldwide forensic intelligence capability that would include chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense laboratories, located worldwide, including combat zones. Funding for this initiative, which will include the areas of post-blast analyses, forensics of identity intelligence, latent print examination, and biometric collection techniques, is expected to total from $\\$ 500$ million to $\\$ 600$ million over a ten-year period. The DIA circulates broad agency announcements for white papers that align with DIA research topics. Current forensic-related research areas include development of new analysis technologies, enhancing counterintelligence and security, intelligence collections, forensic technology advancement for documents and digital media, and data analysis. National Security Agency The National Security Agency (NSA) is responsible for all signals intelligence (SIGINT), involving global monitoring, and collection and processing of information to exploit foreign intelligence as well as supporting US counterintelligence operations. In addition, the NSA Director is the head of the United States Cyber Command, responsible for US government cyberspace operations and the defense of U.S. military networks. As such, digital forensic tools and techniques are critical in its operations and have become a high priority for NSA and its Cyber Command. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a U.S. government agency created in 1953 to support Americans in starting and growing a small business through financial aid and counsel. Eleven government agencies participate in the SBA\u2019s Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The SBIR program provides funding to small early-stage companies with technologies that have commercial and societal impact. The STTR program provides funding for early-stage research and development funding for small companies that collaborate with research institutions to develop technologies. Both programs fund two phases of the three stage process of developing a business: Phase I, focused on determining technical and commercial feasibility, and Phase II, focused on prototyping. Projects that progress to the Phase III stage, commercialization, obtain funding from private sources or government agencies. Each government agency participating in the SBIR/STTR programs chooses proposals that align with their interests and capabilities. Examples of government agencies with SBIR/STTR programs that have forensic-related interests include: Department of Defense The DoD manages the largest subdivision of the SBIR/STTR programs.
