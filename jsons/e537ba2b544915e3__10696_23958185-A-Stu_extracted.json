This chapter will give the overall findings produced by the methods described in Chapter 3. This chapter\u2019s first section will discuss the patterns of intelligence spending, while the second section will describe the workforce of the intelligence industry. The third section will give a brief narrative description of the identified intelligence agencies. The fourth and final section will provide a summary of the results. The Totals: Spending Using the described methods, this study identifies that the world\u2019s intelligence industry spends an estimated \\$106,961,604,308.01 United States Dollars (USD) on an annual basis. The relationship between intelligence spending and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is positive, where for every 947 units of GDP there are two units of intelligence spending. The United States spends the most on intelligence. As shown in Figure 4.1, the US spends about $\\$ 75$ billion dollars, approximately 65 percent of the total amount. According to statistics from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the US\u2019s GDP represents only 23.5 percent of the world\u2019s entire GDP.68 When comparing the US\u2019s portion of intelligence spending to its proportion of the world\u2019s GDP, is it clear that the US spends far more proportionally on intelligence than the rest of the world. Its share of the intelligence pie is roughly double that of its share of GDP.",
